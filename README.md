Slient Speech Recognition : Automatic Lip reading Model using 3D CNN and GRU

# Project Overview
The aim of this app is to demonstrate lip reading capabilities using modern machine learning techniques. Lip reading, or speechreading, utilizes visual cues like mouth movements, tongue placement and facial expressions to deduce spoken words. This project uses a convolutional neural network trained on lip reading data to classify user-generated video input.

# Architecture
## The high-level architecture can be visualized as a decision tree:
### Data Collection: 
Videos of people speaking are compiled into a dataset for model training. Data quantity and variety are essential for generalizability.
### Model Training: 
A CNN is trained on the dataset to learn visual speech patterns. The model architecture and hyperparameters are tuned through experimentation.
### Inference: 
When a user selects  a new video, the trained model analyzes frames to produce class probabilities for each word.
### Classification: 
The most probable word segmentation and transcription is returned to the user as the model's "lip reading".

# Future work
#### - Collect more data to minimize overfitting and expand the vocabulary
#### - Incorporate audio signals as well to leverage multi-modal cues
#### - Develop techniques for disambiguating visually similar words
#### - Explore sequence modeling to capture co-articulation effects
#### - Consider an end-to-end architecture rather than isolated classification
